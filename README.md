Test-driven development (TDD) and object-oriented programming (OOP) can help you create a well-structured and reliable application. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement the game using TDD and OOP concepts:
# Project roadmap
Step 1: Set up your project

Choose a programming language that supports both TDD and OOP, like Python, Java, or C#.
Set up a new project directory and initialize a version control system like Git.
Step 2: Define the game class

Create a class for the game, let's call it GuessingGame.
The class should have attributes to store the target number, the player's attempts, and a flag for the game's status (won/lost).
Define the constructor method to initialize the target number and other attributes.
Step 3: Write unit tests

Write unit tests for the GuessingGame class using a testing framework like JUnit (Java), unittest (Python), or NUnit (C#).
Start by writing tests for the constructor, ensuring that the target number is generated correctly and other attributes are set appropriately.
Step 4: Implement the constructor

Write the constructor method for the GuessingGame class to pass the initial unit tests.
Step 5: Add a method for user input

Create a method within the GuessingGame class to get user input for each guess.
Step 6: Add a method for checking the player's guess

Create a method within the GuessingGame class to compare the player's guess with the target number and update the game status accordingly.
Step 7: Write tests for game logic

Write tests for various game scenarios, including winning and losing conditions, handling input, etc.
Step 8: Implement the game logic

Implement the logic for the game based on the tests you've written.
Step 9: Add a user interface (optional)

If you want to have a graphical user interface (GUI), implement it now, or you can stick with a simple command-line interface.
Step 10: Test the whole application

Run all the unit tests to ensure that the application functions as expected and meets all the business rules.
Step 11: Refactor and optimize (optional)

After verifying that all tests pass, you can refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, and performance.
Step 12: Play and debug

Finally, play the game multiple times, test different scenarios, and debug any issues that may arise.
By following these steps, you'll create a small guessing game application using TDD and OOP concepts. Remember to focus on writing meaningful tests, implementing features incrementally, and refactoring your code as needed to maintain clean and maintainable code.
